"""
Contains Evaluation Suites for Model Training

Notes on Development:
- HF has an evaluation library, but I feel like its not well intergrated into transformers
    - See https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/evaluation_suite and https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/transformers_integrations
- For this work, I think we could create our own compute metrics group class that can handle this work
- That being said, I do like the evaluation library. I will consider allowing thier api to make this work
